# Statistical-Modelling-I-
This is a module where we looked at R and many different statistical techniques and their tests such as: 

  - simple linear regression
  - Multi-Linear regression
  - Anova
  - AIC
  - Mallow's stat
  - VIF 

This Repo contains some of the code that i used in the module for the statistical analysis of different datasets.
